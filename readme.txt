Project title: Cinebot

Instructions:

1: Download and install Microsoft Bot Channel Emulator
2: Download 'HTML Agility Pack' and put it anywhere in your pc.
3: In the Package Manager Console of Visual Studio, write and run the following two commands: 
   "Install-Package Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel"
   "Install-Package HtmlAgilityPack"
4: Before compiling the program, set the path of the excel files to where you have extracted them.
   This will be done in 'MoviesAdderIntoHashArray' class in the 'initializeMovieListWorkbooks' function.
5: Initially, you would have to "run" the program instead of just compiling it so that the IIS server in your pc can be started. 
   You can close the browser, if you want to, that would be opened up immediately. 
6: Start the Emulator that you have already downloaded and begin using the bot by typing anything.
